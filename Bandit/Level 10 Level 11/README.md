* 1. base64
    To encode or decode standard input/output or any file content, Linux uses base64 encoding and decoding 
    system. Data are encoded and decoded to make the data transmission and storing process easier. Encoding 
    and decoding are not similar to encryption and decryption. Encoded data can be easily revealed by 
    decoding. So, this command line utility tool can't be used for data security. Alphabet, 
    number and '=' symbol are used to encode any data.
