# Commands:
* 1. find
    The find command in UNIX is a command line utility for walking a file hierarchy. 
    It can be used to find files and directories and perform subsequent operations on them. 
    It supports searching by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner and permissions. 
    By using the ‘-exec’ other UNIX commands can be executed on files or folders found.
