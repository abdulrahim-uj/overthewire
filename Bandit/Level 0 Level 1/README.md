# Commands:
* 1. ls
    The ls command is used to list files or directories in Linux and other Unix-based operating systems.
    Just like you navigate in your File explorer or Finder with a GUI, 
    the ls command allows you to list all files or directories in the current directory by default, 
    and further interact with them via the command line

* 2. cat
    The cat command is a utility command in Linux. 
    One of its most commonly known usages is to print the content of a file onto the standard output stream. 
    Other than that, the cat command also allows us to write some texts into a file.
