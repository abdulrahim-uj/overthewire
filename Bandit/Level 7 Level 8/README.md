# Commands:
* 1. ls
    The ls command is used to list files or directories in Linux and other Unix-based operating systems.
    Just like you navigate in your File explorer or Finder with a GUI, 
    the ls command allows you to list all files or directories in the current directory by default, 
    and further interact with them via the command line

* 2. grep
    The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that 
    contain that pattern. The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression 
    (grep stands for global search for regular expression and print out).
