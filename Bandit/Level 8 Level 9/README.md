# Commands:
* 1. ls
    The ls command is used to list files or directories in Linux and other Unix-based operating systems.
    Just like you navigate in your File explorer or Finder with a GUI, 
    the ls command allows you to list all files or directories in the current directory by default, 
    and further interact with them via the command line

* 2. sort
    SORT command is used to sort a file, arranging the records in a particular order. By default, 
    the sort command sorts file assuming the contents are ASCII. 
    Using options in the sort command can also be used to sort numerically.

* 3. uniq
    The uniq command in Linux is a command-line utility that reports or filters out the repeated lines in a file. 
    In simple words, uniq is the tool that helps to detect the adjacent duplicate lines and also deletes the 
    duplicate lines. uniq filters out the adjacent matching lines from the input file(that is required as an 
    argument) and writes the filtered data to the output file.
