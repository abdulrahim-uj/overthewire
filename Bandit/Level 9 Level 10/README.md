# Commands:
* 1. ls
    The ls command is used to list files or directories in Linux and other Unix-based operating systems.
    Just like you navigate in your File explorer or Finder with a GUI, 
    the ls command allows you to list all files or directories in the current directory by default, 
    and further interact with them via the command line

* 2. string
    String command in Linux will return each string type of characters that are printable in the file. 
    It is mainly used in determining the contents in the file and extracting the text from binary-type 
    files. A string contains a sequence of finite characters and it can also be considered as one 
    character.
